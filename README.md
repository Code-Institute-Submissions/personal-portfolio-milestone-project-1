User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project - Sophia Rumpus | Resume

I have gone with Project Example Idea 3 of building a personal portfolio site as this is something I can use in real life considering my choice for a career change from marketing to front end development. There are two immediate challenges with this type of project; one, is that a CV/portfolio typically attemps to communicate a large amount of information to the reader (or recruiter) so it is important to break that information up into intuitive categories. I initially wanted to have one fluid page with links to each section but concluded that this would be a cognitive overload, therefore I've chosen to make separate webpages to break the information up. 
The purpose of this project then, is to provide a visual example of my (early) design and coding skills to potential recruiters who are looking for prospective candidates to place into Junior developer roles or similar. 
The second challenge is that the developer industry relies heavily on the actual design and functionality of the website and therefore is a competitive area to display technical skill whilst showcasing aesthetic design, combined with presenting unique personality, whilst remaining a professional space.
I will introduce the UX and the thinking behind this, explanation of the features, technologies used, testing and deployment.  

UX 

This website is for recruiters who are often working to tight deadlines, analysing multiple candidates a day and therefore need to see and process candidate information quickly including the candidate's skill level, their specialities and personality fit for a prospective company. This required presenting key information into clear, concise categories that are easily navigatable and intuitive. 
The value for the web creator, or personal portfolio owner is to present their key skills and personality to the recruiter quickly, in an aestheticly pleasing design to achieve leads for potential career oppurtunities.
A very early mock-up can be found at this link from Canva - a drag and drop online, basic design website which should give at least an idea of initial design creative: https://www.canva.com/design/DAD03zjomoY/Mr0wGcCBeyya65HLl_fkFw/view?utm_content=DAD03zjomoY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink
I chose the theme of a dark overlay over a tropical background as it represents a corporate 'Wayfinding' feel often seen in offices, while tying into my experiences of travelling to tropical locations as demonstrated in the 'About' section. Additionally to this, my profile image, displayed on each page of the website, was taken in a lotus farm in Cambodia, highlighting the tropical theme throughout the website. The white blocks are used to break up and contrast the dark feel to create more simplicity.

Features

I will divide this section by webpage and explain the chosen features on each: 
- Profile: The two sections of 'What I Do' and 'Why Hire Me' are the two main questions recruiters want to see answers for when they are placing candidates into particular roles. The clear split allows the user to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- Work Experience: allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- Portfolio: allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- Education: allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- About: allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- Contact: allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- Footer and Navigation: allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z

Technologies Used 

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

Credits 

Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
